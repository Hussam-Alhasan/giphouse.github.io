####IntelliGUI


We are developing an intelligent GUI to act as a frontend for SPADE-generated applications.

SPADE is CGI’s leading development toolkit, offering rapid prototyping capabilities to businesses around the globe. With SPADE they can create professional software solutions in a fraction of the time because it automates designing (business process designs, GUI designs and system designs), coding and a major part of testing.

Currently the capabilities of SPADE are quite impressive, except for the existing GUI; it’s functional, but very basic. Our team will deliver a completely new GUI, built from scratch: IntelliGUI. It will show, suggest and hide various widgets based on the characteristics of output data of SPADE-generated applications.

Features:

Multiple intelligent widgets (texts, tables, charts, graphs and maps)
End-users can make changes to the GUI at runtime (adding, removing and resizing widgets)
End-users can save and load personal GUI presets
Seamless integration with existing and future SPADE-generated applications.
