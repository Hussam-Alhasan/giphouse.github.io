#### About Optimal Planet

![Optimal Planet logo]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/project/optimalplanet_logo.png)

In the past, Optimal Planet created a custom tool with GiPHouse based on Reinier de Nooij's vision and special methodology. 
The tool was mainly used in workshops, aimed at measuring the sustainability and circularity of participants' products. 

Early 2016, Reinier approached GiPHouse again to extend and further improve the tool. 
The tool would be taken outside its workshop-environment, and should therefore work more intuitively, have extended account management features, and must be configured more flexibly. 
Also, as it will be applied in practice by procurement departments, it must enable users to export results as proof. Various new features have to be added as well.
